/* 

You are given a non-negative number less than or equal to 100000000 (1
followed by 8 zeroes). You have to divide the number into the
following components, and print them in the following order.

1. The part of the number which is less than a thousand.
2. The part of the number which is between a thousand and a lakh
3. The part of the number which is between a lakh and a crore

and so on. You should terminate printing when no higher power of 10 is
present to be printed.

For example, suppose the input number is

134847

Then the output should be
847
34
1

The question can be done with or without using arrays.

Hint: Using % (that is, the modulo operator) and / (the division
operator on integers) is helpful in solving this question.
