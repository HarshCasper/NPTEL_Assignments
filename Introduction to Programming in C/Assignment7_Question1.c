/* 

Create a database of students using structures, where in each entry of the database will have the following fields:
a name, which is a string with at most 128 characters
their marks in physics which is an int between 0 and 100
their marks in chemistry which is an int number between 0 and 100
their marks in mathematics which is an int number between 0 and 100
You have to output a list of students in the following order.
if a student 'A' has lower marks in physics than a student 'B', then A's data is listed before B.
If A and B have the same physics marks and A has lower chemistry marks than B, then A is listed before B.
If A and B have the same marks in physics and chemistry, and A has lower marks in mathematics than B, then A is listed before B.
If all marks are equal and A's name precedes B's name in the dictionary order, then A is listed before B.
.

Input Format :
First line contains the number of students n, where 1<=n<=100.
In following n lines each line contains(space separated)  a name and their respective marks in physics, chemistry, maths, where 0<=marks<=100.

Output Format :
Sorted database of n lines.
