/* 

In a string, a "run" is a substring with consisting of consecutive
occurrences of the same character. For example, the string
"mississippi" contains the following runs - "ss", "ss" and "pp".

In this question, given a string, you have to output the length of the
longest run in the string.

Input
-----
A string, having length at most 100. The string is guaranteed to have
at least one run.

Output
------
The length of the longest run in the string.

Sample Input
------------
abbaaacccc

Sample Output
-------------
4
